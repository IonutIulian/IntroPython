# Homework 4 - Repetitive Cycles

"""Repetitive structures = ways in which we can execute code repeatedly
					until a certain condition is no longer met
					or until we no longer fall within a certain range

There are four types of repetitive structures:
while
do while
for
for each

Ways of controlling repetitive structures:
- break
- continue

1. While is a repetitive structure in which we execute a series of instructions as long as a condition is true
Usually the while control element or variable is declared outside the while.

2.For = repetitive structure that is used when we want to go through a list in order to print the items
or modify them, and respectively when we want to execute a set of instructions of a specific number times (range).
